Furnace
=======

A library for building GUI application, heavily inspired from [React][], [Redux][], and [Relm][].


## Goals

 - [ ] Derive macros to update models in parallel.
 - [ ] A full-featured GUI backend in any platform, instead [libui][].
 - [ ] Hooks, like [Hooks API in React][react-hooks].
 - [ ] Build and update components using the same code.
